    //To do list:
    //merge junior/senior as a single boolean value
    //Implement Controller
    //Connect GUI to controller
    //Connect other functionalities to Controller and GUI.
    //Consider the functionality of the Main Method in registration when the Controller has been implemented
    //Make it possible for the GUI to go back to the main menu after having chosen a role.
    //Change GUI Class names.
    //Clean up redundant GUI code
    
            
    //Stretch goals:
    //Additional basic information for members and trainer (e.g. phonenumber).
    //Make unit test for the .txt files. Test the perfomance of the PrintWriter.

    //top5Members(Diciplin diciplin)
    // - (^ We should create a class for eat diciplin and save
    // - (the top 5 members of each diciplin in their seperate classes)
    
    //Controller methods (methods of which we have yet to implement at all)
    //registerResult()

    //getBalanceSheet()
    //createContingentPayment(Member member);
